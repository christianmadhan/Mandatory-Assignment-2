hide what you you feel inside and the fire has left your eyes on silent wings i see us in our dreams and were dancing i can almost hear the song but the prayers they go unanswered but we both know were just hanging on i feel ashamed but ill never know the reason why the rug was pulled so gently from under my feet i only know that something good has died between you and me oh its just a memory you never see it coming you just go separate ways on silent wings silent wings theres no more promises to break or our love has slipped away on silent wings you never see it coming but you know it has to end on silent wings silent wings i will never be the same again i feel the whisper of the wind on silent wings in the desert sun every step that you take could be the final one in the burning heat

knows all good in the zone something you dont have to tell me something you dont have to sell me  im feeling so  believe in me  and what wasnt said i wasnt lying and what do i have to do its not for lack of trying  what i dont know  believe in me as i develop the awakening mind i praise the buddha as they shine i bow before you as i travel my path to join your ranks i make my full time task for the sake of all beings i seek the enlighted mind that i know ill reap respect to shantideva and all the others who brought down the darma for sisters and brothers i give thanks for this world as a place to learn and for this human body that im glad to have earned and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings for without them there would be no place to learn what im seeing theres nothing here thats not been said before but i put it down now so ill be sure to solidify my own views and ill be glad if it helps anyone else out too  if others disrespect me or give me flack ill stop and think before i react knowing that theyre going through insecure stages ill take the opportunity to exercise patience ill see it as a chance to help the other person nip it in the bud before it can worsen a change for me to be strong and sure as i think on the buddhas who have come before as i praise and respect the good theyve done knowing only love can conquer in every situation we need other people in order to create the circumstances for the learning that were here to generate situations that bring up our deepest fears so we can work to release them until theyre cleared therefore it only makes sense to thank our enemies despite their intent  the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength a strength from within to go the length seeing others are as important as myself i strive for a happiness of mental wealth with the interconnectedness that we share as one every action that we take affects everyone so in deciding for what a situation calls there is a path for the good for all i try to make my every action for that highest good with the altruistic wish to achive buddhahood so i pledge here before everyone whos listening to try to make my every action for the good of all beings for the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond i vow to do my best to do no harm and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma body movin body movin  sound sound so soothing body movin body

water from the tap clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane i pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games people say this is the playlist of the void nonbound but i can say this is the plainness of the peace ive found its not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle its the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles scandelescent in the means i have dreamed on the schemes reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes can i get a witness to testify open your eyes realize electrify so i plan and i scam and write it off on my taxes its times like these ill just go with the decisions of the masses and to the crowds whove come before with their profit massing ways to the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today with pain i stand sane and remain holding strong whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs its illogical the actions that are typically displayed a set back aint all that much problem to invade so i will glow like a lantern on a new moon night ill fight violence with these hands that werent built to fight but like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed can i get a witness to testify open your eyes realize electrify so mike d

can flip a rhyme off the tip of my tongue switching up the rhythm like the rhymes a piece of chewing gum now i might chew but i dont bite my ideas are mine when i begin to write in my sleep ill be thinking bout beats and getting on the mic and busting some treats and sporting the crazy funky threads that youve never even seen before what im lacking from the macking i can find at the thrift store i wont scuff nor scuffle just grin as they walk by take time to rhyme for a girl i hear talk fly down some papaya down with the revolution always wear my goggles cause theres so much pollution i can do the freak the patty duke and the spank gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks ill sell my house sell my car and ill sell all my stuff im going back to new york city i do believe ive had enough im flowing prose to cons and cons to pros im scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know but beyond the concepts and emotions that rise to the interconnectedness that underlies the lies upon lies have lost their meaning the plies upon plies of consciousness that is being over and over i fall i learned to walk from a crawl its not sad its just the way and the purpose of it all now every word that you heard that i said that you felt was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt i steal feels from reels but i pay my respects paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects words are water as i court her as she is pristine words and mics fall to dust and all thats left is the feelings i give in and i win i try to never complain intentions venture to center and then they set the stage but ill remain sane making gain without pain staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain and keep it positive as painstaking as it is ill never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live so like a cloud carries rain im gonna carry my rhyme coming like thunder with lightening timing no hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans ferment time like wine no ploys or scams like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas woke up this morning right out of a dream reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme what can i do with these bones and flesh with these animated thoughts in a world repressed im going down like the rhythms on the winds
